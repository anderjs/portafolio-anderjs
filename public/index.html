                My first job started in a company called 4geeks, which is now called CobuildLab, I worked there about 8 months and I developed 3 projects in React with Flux Architecture. During all that time I experimented with very good technologies. And I also knew about certain technologies such as Python, Twilios, and PostGreSQL. Also I can say that I learn very fast and I adapt to any technology without problems.

                <span class="badge pill bg-primary text-light">As Front End Developer</span> When Massone made the contract with the company where I worked, they asked us to create a web system that would be able to create, edit, eliminate users with roles, in addition where they could register calls, create jobs for their employees and tag them. All this with a backend designed in Django (Python Framework), this was my first project I have made great contributions, and thus ending a first phase of the project successfully. There were many changes where I had to debugge mostly the code we did. But the logic of the interface remained excellent.

                When the version we were developing in Massone was finished, enter a new project called PEX Plus, which had a second phase. This second phase began as a startup in which emerged from an idea in which we were supporting the product. Therefore, I have to carry out the whole project in the part of the development of the interface logic, and components. The website had a search engine, results pager, preview of products, search filters based on categories, labels and prices. In addition to being able to show prices in ascending order. It was here when I met Auth0 to develop a fast authentication without the need to use a backend. I also had the opportunity to work with a backend developer in Golang. In such a way that we had to implement AwardWallet, Google and Facebook APIs in order to synchronize the account data and display them. I concluded with my work in PEX + in the development part of the Front End. In addition I did unit tests, and UI Testing in React.js with Enzyme Adapter.

                For personal reasons I did not manage to finish accountable, but I made a number of contributions during the development process. Like the integration of Firebase, creation of components, and behavior of forms, animations, and connections with third-party APIs. In my experience I used Cheerio.js to be able to capture a plain text where standard HTML came in text. Apply my techniques as a programmer to get labels and in this way make a connection with Blogger (Google Blogspot) and show images, and blog author. In this way if the user created a post on his blog in accountabble will also appear. My duty was to integrate Stripe, Mailchimp and Google Drive APIs. But due to personal issues leave pending issues.
                I also applied Cloud functions with Firebase which was an extra to my experience as a developer.
